## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Backend** | PHP 8.x (PDO, prepared statements) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Render PostgreSQL) |
| **Server** | Apache (XAMPP) |
| **CSS** | Bootstrap 5.3.2, Bootstrap Icons 1.11.3 |
| **JavaScript** | jQuery 3.7.1, Select2 4.1.0, Chart.js 4.4.1 |
| **Auth** | bcrypt password hashing, PHP sessions |

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- XAMPP (or any Apache + PHP stack)
- PHP 8.0+
- PostgreSQL 13+

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository into XAMPP's htdocs
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sports-meet-portal.git
# or copy the folder to C:\xampp\htdocs\<your-folder>

# 2. Create/select the target PostgreSQL database and import the schema
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/schema.sql

Run this from a machine with the PostgreSQL client installed, or use Render's PostgreSQL
database connection tools. The web container only needs the PHP `pdo_pgsql` extension.

Do not import `database/sports_meet_portal.sql`; it is the legacy MySQL dump kept only
as a possible source for the migration utility.

# 3. Configure the PostgreSQL connection with DATABASE_URL or NCSM_DATABASE_URL.

# 4. Start Apache and PostgreSQL locally, or use Docker.

# 5. Seed the database with default data from the command line
$env:NCSM_SEED_PASSWORD = "use-a-unique-password-at-least-12-characters"
php seed_cli.php
# Log in with username `admin` and the seed password, then change it.

# 6. Access the application
# Visit: http://localhost/<your-folder>/
```

> **Note:** The application auto-detects its folder, so it works from any
> folder name with no code changes.

## Render Deployment

This repository includes a `Dockerfile` and `render.yaml` for a Docker web service and
Render PostgreSQL database:

- `NCSM_APP_URL` — the complete HTTPS application URL with no trailing slash
- `DATABASE_URL` — Render's internal PostgreSQL connection string
- `NCSM_SEED_PASSWORD` — a unique password of at least 12 characters
- `NCSM_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
- `NCSM_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — optional public API key used in storage requests
- `NCSM_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only legacy `service_role` JWT or newer `sb_secret_...` key used to upload/delete images
- `NCSM_SUPABASE_BUCKET` — the public Supabase Storage bucket name for images

### Required deployment order

1. Deploy the blueprint in `render.yaml`. It creates a Render PostgreSQL database and injects
	its `connectionString` into `DATABASE_URL`. Set the remaining `sync: false` variables:
	`NCSM_APP_URL`, `NCSM_SEED_PASSWORD`, and the Supabase Storage variables if you want
	permanent CDN-backed image hosting. Keep secrets in Render's environment settings, never in Git.
2. Import the schema into Render PostgreSQL:

	```bash
	psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/schema.sql
	```

3. If this is a new installation with no existing data, seed once after the schema import.
	Run this from a trusted machine with the target database environment variables set:

	```bash
	NCSM_SEED_PASSWORD='use-a-new-password-at-least-12-chars' php seed_cli.php
	```

	Change the `admin` password immediately after the first login.
4. For existing MySQL records, do not run the PostgreSQL schema against the old database.
	Import the schema into the new Render database, set `NCSM_SOURCE_DB_HOST`,
	`NCSM_SOURCE_DB_PORT`, `NCSM_SOURCE_DB_NAME`, `NCSM_SOURCE_DB_USER`, and
	`NCSM_SOURCE_DB_PASS`, and keep `DATABASE_URL` set to Render PostgreSQL, then run:

	```bash
	php database/migrate_existing.php
	```

	Run this before seeding so existing IDs and users are preserved. The migration preserves
	IDs and skips duplicate rows. Take a backup first and verify row counts before switching
	traffic. After migration, run `php seed_cli.php` once only if default reference data or
	accounts are missing.
5. Uploads are intentionally excluded from Git and Docker. Copy the old uploads directory
	to the persistent disk using the configured target path:

	```bash
	php scripts/migrate_uploads.php /path/to/old/uploads
	```

	On Render, the persistent disk is mounted at `/var/www/html/uploads`. For large or highly
	available media, use object storage instead of the single-service disk.

6. To store player and gallery images permanently in Supabase Storage, create a public bucket
	and set these environment variables:

	```bash
	NCSM_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
	NCSM_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
	NCSM_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
	NCSM_SUPABASE_BUCKET=ncsm-media
	```

	New player and gallery image uploads will go to Supabase Storage. If these variables are
	not configured, the application continues using local uploads on the persistent disk.

After deployment, verify `/`, login, document download authorization, player registration,
an existing migrated player, and an uploaded image. Never paste database passwords into the
repository, README, shell history, or chat.

## Default Users

The initial accounts are created with the one-time `NCSM_SEED_PASSWORD` value. Change it
after the first login and do not commit that value to the repository.
